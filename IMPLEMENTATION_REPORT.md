# PulseCord Implementation Report

## Scope

The supplied `fixseda.zip` snapshot was audited and repaired in place. No repository, production database, Railway project, or environment secret was accessed or modified.

## Baseline verification

The supplied project passed the following local checks before the repair:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test` — 10/10 tests passed
- `npm run build`
- `npm audit --omit=dev` — 0 runtime vulnerabilities reported

The full development dependency audit still reports four moderate advisories in the development-only dependency chain. They were not automatically changed because the audit output did not provide a safe runtime-relevant upgrade and changing the toolchain could destabilize the existing build.

## Repair implemented

### Realtime event reconciliation

Previously, every Socket.IO event received by the frontend triggered `loadAllData()`, which issued up to 11 full-table requests and then rerendered the application. This was wasteful and could cause overlapping requests and stale response races during active messaging.

`js/app.js` now reconciles these events locally:

- `message_new`, `message_updated`, and `message_deleted`
- `direct_message_new`, `direct_message_updated`, and `direct_message_deleted`
- `voice_updated`, including removal events

Only the affected in-memory collection is updated and rendered. Structural changes, permission changes, membership revocations, and other events retain the existing full synchronization path.

### Voice and screen-share UI improvements

The voice theater was upgraded without replacing the existing LiveKit integration. The stage now includes a dedicated “In voice” strip with a live participant count, avatars, speaking indication, and compact participant chips. Screen shares are promoted to a large featured surface while camera tiles remain visible in a compact responsive layout. The Focus/Fullscreen control now expands the complete voice theater instead of only the inner grid, and mobile-specific sizing was added for narrow screens.

## Post-repair verification

After the change:

- `npm run lint` — passed
- `npm test` — 10/10 passed
- `npm run build` — passed
- Tailwind CSS compilation and LiveKit browser bundle generation — passed
- Local browser smoke check — login shell rendered successfully over the local preview URL

The build emitted only the existing non-blocking `caniuse-lite is outdated` warning.

## Features still not verified or implemented

The archive itself documents these limitations, which were not represented as completed features:

- PostgreSQL migration and real database operations were not run because no database connection was supplied.
- Railway deployment and production health checks were not performed.
- LiveKit voice, camera, screen sharing, reconnect, and multi-user behavior were not end-to-end verified because no LiveKit runtime credentials or multiple authenticated browsers were supplied.
- File attachments and object storage are not implemented.
- Direct-message voice/video calling is not implemented.
- Private-channel ACLs, MFA, email verification, password recovery, and refresh tokens are not implemented.
- Socket.IO is single-instance only and has no Redis adapter.

These items must not be reported as passing until tested against the real services.
